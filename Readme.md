In this repo, you will see some of the common ways to solve the everyday problems in JavaScript using efficient ways. 

For example, how to avoid for loop inside another for loop by using a technique called Frequency Counter. 

All this is based on content from "https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/". If you love JavaScript and want to learn Datasctructures and Algorithms, I highly recommend this course.

More to come...
