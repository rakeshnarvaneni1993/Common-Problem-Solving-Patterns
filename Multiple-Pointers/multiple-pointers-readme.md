This pattern helps you solve when you have to find a pair of two data elements from a sorted multiple data elements (Ex: Array of integers).

For example, given a sorted array, finding the first pair that sum up to 5. If this problem were given, traditional solution is to create a loop which will hold one pointer to index and another loop inside this loop to look for the second number that matches the criteria. 

If done in traditional way, the complexity of the solution is O(n^2). But with the implementation that I demonstrated in multiple-pointers.js, complexity will come to O(n).

Find the code in JS file. Both the methods are explained there.
