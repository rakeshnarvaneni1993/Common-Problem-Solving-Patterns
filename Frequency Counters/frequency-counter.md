This is useful in algorithms and challenges when you have multiple pieces of data and multiple
inputs and you need to compare them to see if they consist of similar values.

For example, when you have two arrays and want to check if all the elements from array1 are present in array2. In this case, usually, we have a loop inside a loop which does the trick. But, the complexity of loop inside a loop is O(n^2). Instead, this method of using JavaScript objects gives you a way to reduce the time complexity to O(n).

Find the code in JS file. Both the methods are explained ther.
