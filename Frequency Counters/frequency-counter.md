This is useful in algorithms and challenges when you have multiple pieces of data and multiple
inputs and you need to compare them.

For example, when you have two arrays and want to check if all the elements from array1 are present in array2. In this case, usually, we approach this by having a loop inside a loop which does the trick. But, the complexity of loop inside a loop is O(n^2). Instead, this method of using JavaScript objects gives you a way to reduce the time complexity to O(n).

This way depends on creating JS objects from the arrays and using the objects to compare the arrays. This way the number of loops might be higher, but the overall complexity is significantly lower (O(n^2) to O(n)).

Find the code in JS file. Both the methods are explained there.
